The [mini footer](https://getmdl.io/components/index.html#layout-section/footer) is used by this theme, along with the use of a right aligned social icons section, which can be enabled separatley. Be default, it is not shown unless a footer menu has been created.

In WordPress, create a menu and assign it a theme location of "Footer Main Menu". Add links to relevant pages as normal.

### Footer Social Icons
This is an additional menu that can be shown in the footer, with links to external websites. It will not be shown unless a footer menu has been created and set up.

Create a menu and assign it a theme location of "Footer Social Menu".

Create a custom link with the URL to the external website and a link text that is one of the [Material Design Iconic Font social icons](http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/icons.html#social) (GitHub in the exmaple below). The social icons will then appear.
